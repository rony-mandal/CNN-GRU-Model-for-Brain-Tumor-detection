# ML Model- Training and Testing Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline, including training and evaluation of a model using Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab. It includes two main components:

- `training_model.ipynb`: Builds and trains a machine learning model.
- `testing_model.ipynb`: Loads and evaluates the trained model on test data.


## 🚀 Features

- End-to-end model development in Python
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Reproducible notebooks for experimentation
- Easy integration with Google Colab and GitHub

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, pandas
- scikit-learn (or TensorFlow/PyTorch depending on the notebook)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- Google Colab

## 🧪 How to Use

### Run on Google Colab:

You can open the notebooks directly in Google Colab:

- [Open Training Notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rony-mandal/CNN-GRU-Model-for-Brain-Tumor-detection/blob/main/training_model.ipynb)
- [Open Testing Notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rony-mandal/CNN-GRU-Model-for-Brain-Tumor-detection/blob/main/testing_model.ipynb)

### Run Locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rony-mandal/CNN-GRU-Model-for-Brain-Tumor-detection.git
   cd CNN-GRU-Model-for-Brain-Tumor-detection
